# Think twice before becoming Cenk Sahinalp's student

![cenk_sahinalp_-_235px](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/assets/10753120/7f973a64-f583-4fd9-8ec9-65cb4a08c32c)

[Dr. S. Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/s-cenk-sahinalp) is an accomplished scholar in bioinformatics. His research excellence is remarkable: apart from his shiny titles and outstanding publications, I also heard people, including both his students and collaborators, praising his research work in private conversations. He is said to have a solid grasp of his research fields, and whatever paper he writes is guaranteed good quality.

However, a great researcher as he is, I have a very negative judgment of him, both as a supervisor and as a person, although I've never been his student or directly interacted with him in any way.

**He is very selfish, completely disregarding his responsibility or other people's interests while pursuing his own interest, probably even committing minor fraud. It may even suffice to say, he is despicable.**

## Problem 1: Deceptive

**He is deceptive and doesn't care about his students.** Dr. Sahinalp has been a professor at Simon Fraser University (SFU) between 2003 and 2019, but between 2013 and 2019, he was also a professor at Indiana University Bloomington. Do you think he spent around half-half time in each of those universities during this overlapping period of 2013-2019? No. Ever since he started working at Indiana University, he rarely (if ever at all) returned to SFU in person, only holding a position in SFU; however, when recruiting students to SFU, he told them he'd be "at SFU half the time". The students would find out the truth only after starting their studies at SFU, then they had to find another local professor/postdoc to act as an on-site co-supervisor, while having a weekly 1-1 video conferencing with Cenk. At least that's what happened to some cohorts of students I know of, but most likely, other cohorts suffered a similar fate, based on Cenk's selfish and irresponsible character depicted in this article. At the time, we joked that Cenk was like a "shadow figure" in our department: we hear about his name frequently, but never see him in real life.

You might think that video conferencing with Cenk is still very helpful for those students, but meeting Cenk in person shouldn't be a privilege in the first place: it should be their right, unless they were informed of his complete absence before they accepted their PhD/MSc offers. Even with tools like video conferencing, face-to-face interaction is still indispensable, especially in a close relationship like a supervisor-student relationship, and even more so for supervisors and students who have never met in person. This distance and unfamiliarity don't bode well for the quality of guidance those students would get, but Cenk couldn't care less. This deception from Cenk probably constitutes a minor fraud ([definition](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-380.html)).

## Problem 2: Extremely irresponsible

**His irresponsibility severely harms both his and other professors' students.** From what I know, Cenk's inaction and irresponsibility were a major factor behind the early termination of SFU's MADD-Gen program, which was a bioinformatics program funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada). After its termination by NSERC at the end of 2016, graduate students recruited under this program had their funding sources cut off (yes, SFU professors continued recruiting students to this program until its last day without telling them the truth, despite knowing its termination well in advance), and I was hit especially hard, suffering from economic hardship for years (see [this article](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md) for more details and how I fought back). 

It got terminated prematurely due to MADD-Gen committee's failure to meet the promises they made to NSERC when creating this program. The MADD-Gen committee was mostly comprised of some SFU professors, including Cenk. To get the funding, the committee promised things like offering certain courses, offering students exchange opportunities, getting students into internship programs, etc. These were also selling points to attract prospective graduate students. When Cenk was the rotational chair of the MADD-Gen program, he neglected his administrative responsibilities, only focusing on his work at Indiana University. Some older students told me that Cenk didn't send students for exchange or internship during this period. Although these activities resumed to normal levels after another professor became the rotational chair, it was too little too late: the damage was already done, NSERC doubted the committee's competence and commitment to fulfill promises in the future, leading to the decision to terminate the funding.

**This story clearly showed how selfish and despicable Cenk truly was.** 

Unlike the committee's other failures that are more justified, for example, being unable to open some promised courses due to little to no students enrolling, sending students for exchange or internship is relatively easy: it just requires a small amount of attention and effort from the program chair, he didn't have to create anything new, as the exchange and internship programs were already running smoothly under the earlier rotational chairs. Yet Cenk refused to fulfill such a simple responsibility, probably because it wouldn't benefit him personally, and he didn't care about the students' development or the long-term success of MADD-Gen program.

I wonder whether Cenk tried any alternatives, like asking other colleagues to help arrange student exchanges. Likely not.

If the pursuit of his personal interest prevented Cenk from fulfilling such a simple responsibility, despite knowing its grave economic consequences for many students, do you think it's even possible that he'll perform some other duties faithfully? If he has to choose between your interest and his own, do you think he'll even hesitate for one second? 

***Cenk doesn't even honor the promises he made to the FUNDING agency, why would he honor the promises he made to you, once you become his student, or even collaborator?***

**Besides, it also exhibited an astonishing amount of incompetence and irresponsibility in the SFU School of Computing Science.**

The MADD-Gen committee was a team. When Cenk slacked off, his teammates should pick up where he left off to ensure the team's success, which obviously didn't happen. Overall, this was a very incompetent and irresponsible team, people just sit back to see things fail without even attempting to salvage the situation. To make matters worse, those team members even continued recruiting students to the MADD-Gen program until its last day without telling them the truth, despite knowing its termination well in advance, which constituted fraud based on the [Canada Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-380.html).

Similar to Dr. Sahinalp, those professors are likely also very selfish and have questionable moral standards. They include [Dr. Martin Ester](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md) (my own supervisor), Dr. Cedric Chauve, Dr. Leonid Chindelevitch, Dr. Funda Ergun, Dr. Arrvindh Shriraman, and probably many others. You can refer to [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160802213853/http://www.sfu.ca/madd-gen/faculty-researchers.html) for more info. Apart from Dr. Martin Ester, I don't know whether other aforementioned professors deceived and under-funded their students similarly, but I think some level of deception existed.

Like Cenk but to a lesser degree, if those people didn't even honor the promises they made to the FUNDING agency, why would they honor the promises made to you, once you become their student?

### Defense for Cenk and its rebuttals

Now let's come up with a defense for Cenk. Note that I don't know the complete truth, so this argument is hypothetical: When Cenk became the MADD-Gen program's rotational chair, it was already quite obvious that some of MADD-Gen program's promises couldn't be kept, e.g., the promised course offerings. Thus, the program's termination would be inevitable regardless of whether Cenk worked on student exchanges and internships. If so, is Cenk still very guilty?

I think this argumentâ€™s implicit assumption of a strict NSERC is invalid. Scientific research is inherently risky, forcing things to go completely as planned discourages riskier scientific explorations, but those riskier explorations potentially lead to more breakthrough discoveries than safer research, being overly strict would hinder scientific development. Hence, I think NSERC should have some tolerance for failure to meet certain promises, as long as there are proper justifications. However, what Cenk did was not justifiable. He is very guilty for the following reasons:

1. This incompetent and irresponsible management truly disappointed NSERC, eliminating any hope they probably once had in MADD-Gen committee;
2. Those promises were also made to students, Cenk's failure to keep these promises unlawfully breaches the obligations set out in those students' offer letters.

Reason #2 is self-explanatory, let's dive deeper into reason #1. I think NSERC's disappointments are as follows:

1. **This incident shows MADD-Gen committee isn't engaged in the program.** If there are truly insurmountable difficulties in fulfilling their promises, NSERC would likely understand it and be forgiving. But clearly, this doesn't apply to sending students for exchange and internship. If they cannot do, or even TRY to do such a simple thing, it's a problem with attitude and engagement. Then why give precious money to a bunch of professors who aren't engaged or committed?
2. **This incident shows MADD-Gen committee has terrible leadership and execution.** It forms a vicious cycle with the engagement problem: poor leadership and execution can lead to low engagement, while low engagement makes the leadership and execution even weaker.
   1. Being the rotational chair of the program, why didn't Cenk do anything to prevent or mitigate the issue before it was too late? Isn't this problem completely foreseeable and solvable?
   2. Why other professors didn't take matters into their own hands to solve the problem early on? Why was the MADD-Gen program in disarray and stayed dysfunctional for such a long time?
   3. What gives NSERC the confidence that this terrible leadership and execution can improve dramatically overnight, turning things around and meeting expectations in the future?   
3. **This incident shows MADD-Gen committee has problematic work ethics and perhaps morality in general.** As mentioned before, if those professors don't even honor the promises made to the funding agency, what promises will they honor? As for Cenk, he didn't even ATTEMPT to keep the promise, whose making he took part in, which makes him a liar, because making promises you never intend to keep is a form of lying. It's common sense not to trust liars.
   1. Cenk obviously favored his own interest, so much so that he didn't care about his responsibilities to the program, to the students, and to the funding agency. This is a major problem with work ethics and with overall morality. His lack of morality likely emanates in other aspects. What if his research funded by NSERC contains fake data and results? In that case, wouldn't NSERC be an accomplice in academic misconduct? What if he embezzles the NSERC funding?
   2. Cenk likely also affects other members of the MADD-Gen committee due to their close relationship, especially considering Cenk's research prowess making him influential, if not a role model, in this social circle. What if they also have problematic work ethics and overall morality under Cenk's influence? What if the funding is used to produce fake data and results, or embezzled by these professors?
4. **The committee didn't take effective disciplinary measures to prevent similar things from happening again.** If Cenk were working in a company, he'd likely be fired "for cause" due to "failure to perform job duties", but the university can't fire a tenured professor for "minor" incidents like this. Besides, other members of the MADD-Gen committee were his peers instead of superiors, they've got no administrative power to criticize or discipline Cenk. In fact, they can't afford to offend him (believe me, he's easily offended), jeopardizing their future opportunities to cooperate with Cenk in research projects.
   1. No one dares to ask Cenk to write a COE (Correction of Error) document or take training, which is commonplace in a company. Without these disciplinary measures, NSERC won't be confident that Cenk and the committee have thoroughly reflected upon this incident and learned from their mistakes, taking necessary precautions in the future.
   2. After this incident, no administrative staff with the power to discipline professors were invited to oversee or join the MADD-Gen committee, as can be seen [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160802213853/http://www.sfu.ca/madd-gen/faculty-researchers.html). Even if they created disciplinary mechanism to prevent or mitigate issues, no one had the administrative power to enforce it. I wonder whether the committee members even tried to invite anyone; I guess not, who'd rather get a boss to oversee your performance when you can just relax? As for the consequence of funding termination, just let the innocent and vulnerable students bear it, who cares? After all, students are at the bottom of this power hierarchy, doomed to be exploited and mistreated. 

These huge red flags should've been critical in the termination decision. Although they existed with the MADD-Gen committee as a whole, it was Cenk's behavior that revealed all of them to NSERC, so I think he's very guilty.

## Problem 3: Difficult to get along with

I heard this quote from some of his students. For a student, this shouldn't be a big issue: as long as your supervisor is a good person and competent researcher, some challenges in your relationship could be the price you're willing to take. After all, no one is perfect.

But now we know his other problems, this problem becomes harder to ignore: they literally "add insult to injury". I guess "difficult to get along with" means Cenk is: 
- rude
- bad temper, easily offended
- self-centered without regard for other people's feelings or interests
- probably has moral issues which makes you feel nasty
- probably (?) asks for higher authorship than he truly deserves

I cannot speculate too much and I'll stop here. But in my opinion, unless this problem is significantly impacting your psychological health, it shouldn't be much of a concern: there are always more important aspects to focus on.

## Implications for readers

I said a lot of bad things about Dr. Sahinalp. However, based on my limited understanding of him, he's actually okay in academia. At least 20% of all professors could be worse than him. Meanness and misconduct are so rampant in academia that, it effectively lowers the participants' moral standards and when assessing a professor, we must use more lenient criteria than elsewhere. Due to the nature of academia, lots of these issues are not made known to the outside world, professors end up enjoying a higher social status than they truly deserve. I'll write another article about this dark side in the future.
