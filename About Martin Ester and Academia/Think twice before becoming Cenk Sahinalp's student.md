# Think twice before becoming Cenk Sahinalp's student

[Dr. S. Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/s-cenk-sahinalp) is an accomplished scholar in bioinformatics. His research excellence is remarkable: apart from his shiny titles and outstanding publications, I also heard people, including both his students and collaborators, praising his research work in private. He is said to have a solid grasp of his research fields, and whatever paper he writes is guaranteed good quality.

However, a great researcher as he is, I have a very negative judgment of him, both as a supervisor and as a person, although I've never been his student or directly interacted with him in any way.

**He is very selfish, completely disregarding his responsibility or other people's interests while pursuing his own interest, probably even committing minor fraud. It may even suffice to say, he is slightly despicable.**

**The first problem: he is deceptive and doesn't care about his students.** Dr. Sahinalp has been a professor at Simon Fraser University (SFU) between 2003 and 2019, but between 2013 and 2019, he was also a professor at Indiana University Bloomington. Do you think he spent around half-half time in each of those universities during this overlapping period of 2013-2019? No. Ever since he started working at Indiana University, he rarely (if ever at all) returned to SFU in person, only holding a position in SFU; however, when recruiting students to SFU, he told them he'd be "at SFU half the time". The students would find out the truth only after starting their studies at SFU, then they had to find another local professor/postdoc to act as an on-site co-supervisor, while having a weekly 1-1 video conferencing with Cenk. At least that's what happened to some cohorts of students I know of, but most likely, other cohorts suffered a similar fate, based on Cenk's selfish and irresponsible character depicted in this article. At the time, we joked that Cenk was like a "shadow figure" in our department: we hear about his name frequently, but never see him in real life.

You might think that video conferencing with Cenk is still very helpful for those students, but meeting Cenk in person should never be a privilege for them in the first place: it should be a right, unless they were informed of his complete absence before they accepted the PhD/MSc offer. Even with tools like video conferencing, face-to-face interaction is still indispensable, especially in a close relationship like a supervisor-student relationship, and even more so for supervisors and students who have never met in person. This distance and unfamiliarity don't bode well for the quality of guidance those students would get, but Cenk couldn't care less. This deception from Cenk probably constitutes a minor fraud ([definition](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-380.html)).

**The second problem: his irresponsibility severely harms both his and other professors' students.** Cenk was heavily involved in a bioinformatics program at SFU called MADD-Gen, funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada). This program was short-lived, terminated by NSERC at the end of the 2016 calendar year, creating huge troubles for many graduate students previously funded by this program, and I was hit especially hard (see [this article](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md) for more details). The reason for its premature termination is its failure to meet the promises made by the MADD-Gen committee when they established this program to apply for funding from NSERC. From what I know, Cenk's inaction and irresponsibility were a major factor behind this failure.
