# Think twice before becoming Cenk Sahinalp's student

[Dr. S. Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/s-cenk-sahinalp) is an accomplished scholar in bioinformatics. His research excellence is remarkable: apart from his shiny titles and outstanding publications, I also heard people, including both his students and collaborators, praising his research work in private conversations. He is said to have a solid grasp of his research fields, and whatever paper he writes is guaranteed good quality.

However, a great researcher as he is, I have a very negative judgment of him, both as a supervisor and as a person, although I've never been his student or directly interacted with him in any way.

**He is very selfish, completely disregarding his responsibility or other people's interests while pursuing his own interest, probably even committing minor fraud. It may even suffice to say, he is despicable.**

## Problem 1: Deceptive

**He is deceptive and doesn't care about his students.** Dr. Sahinalp has been a professor at Simon Fraser University (SFU) between 2003 and 2019, but between 2013 and 2019, he was also a professor at Indiana University Bloomington. Do you think he spent around half-half time in each of those universities during this overlapping period of 2013-2019? No. Ever since he started working at Indiana University, he rarely (if ever at all) returned to SFU in person, only holding a position in SFU; however, when recruiting students to SFU, he told them he'd be "at SFU half the time". The students would find out the truth only after starting their studies at SFU, then they had to find another local professor/postdoc to act as an on-site co-supervisor, while having a weekly 1-1 video conferencing with Cenk. At least that's what happened to some cohorts of students I know of, but most likely, other cohorts suffered a similar fate, based on Cenk's selfish and irresponsible character depicted in this article. At the time, we joked that Cenk was like a "shadow figure" in our department: we hear about his name frequently, but never see him in real life.

You might think that video conferencing with Cenk is still very helpful for those students, but meeting Cenk in person shouldn't be a privilege in the first place: it should be their right, unless they were informed of his complete absence before they accepted their PhD/MSc offers. Even with tools like video conferencing, face-to-face interaction is still indispensable, especially in a close relationship like a supervisor-student relationship, and even more so for supervisors and students who have never met in person. This distance and unfamiliarity don't bode well for the quality of guidance those students would get, but Cenk couldn't care less. This deception from Cenk probably constitutes a minor fraud ([definition](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-380.html)).

## Problem 2: Extremely irresponsible

**Another problem is that, his irresponsibility severely harms both his and other professors' students.** From what I know, Cenk's inaction and irresponsibility were a major factor behind the early termination of SFU's MADD-Gen program, which was a bioinformatics program funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada). After its termination by NSERC at the end of 2016, graduate students recruited under this program had their funding sources cut off (yes, SFU professors continued recruiting students to this program until its last day without telling them the truth, despite knowing its termination well in advance), and I was hit especially hard (see [this article](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md) for more details and how I fought back). 

It got terminated prematurely due to MADD-Gen committee's failure to meet the promises they made to NSERC when creating this program. The MADD-Gen committee was mostly comprised of some SFU professors, including Cenk. To get the funding, the committee made many promises including offering certain courses, offering students exchange opportunities, getting students into internship programs, etc. These were also selling points to attract prospective graduate students. When Cenk was the rotational chair of the MADD-Gen program, he neglected his administrative responsibilities, only focusing on his work at Indiana University. Some older students told me that Cenk didn't send students for exchange or internship during this period. Although these activities resumed to normal levels after another professor became the rotational chair, it was too little too late: they'd never be able to reach the promised number of exchange and intern students, and the funding termination would be inevitable.

**This story clearly showed how selfish and despicable Cenk truly was.** 

Unlike the committee's other failures that are more justified, for example, being unable to open some promised courses due to little to no students enrolling, sending students for exchange or internship is relatively easy: it just requires a small amount of attention and effort from the program chair, he didn't have to create anything new, as the exchange and internship programs were already running smoothly under the earlier rotational chairs. Yet Cenk refused to fulfill such a simple responsibility, probably because it wouldn't benefit him personally, and he didn't care about the students' development or the long-term success of MADD-Gen program.

I wonder whether Cenk tried any alternatives, like asking other colleagues to help arrange student exchanges. Likely not.

If the pursuit of his personal interest prevented Cenk from fulfilling such a simple responsibility, despite knowing its grave economic consequences for many students, do you think it's even possible that he'll perform some other duties faithfully? If he has to choose between your interest and his own, do you think he'll even hesitate for one second? 

***Cenk doesn't even honor the promises he made to the FUNDING agency, why would he honor the promises he made to you, once you become his student, or even collaborator?***

**Besides, it also exhibited an astonishing amount of incompetence and irresponsibility in the SFU School of Computing Science.**

The MADD-Gen committee was a team. When Cenk slacked off, his teammates should pick up where he left off to ensure the team's success, which obviously didn't happen. Overall, this was a very incompetent and irresponsible team, people just sit back to see things fail without even attempting to salvage the situation. To make matters worse, those team members even continued recruiting students to the MADD-Gen program until its last day without telling us the truth, despite knowing its termination well in advance, which constituted fraud based on the [Canada Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-380.html).

Similar to Dr. Sahinalp, those professors are also very selfish and have questionable moral standards. They include [Dr. Martin Ester](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md) (my own supervisor), Dr. Cedric Chauve, Dr. Leonid Chindelevitch, Dr. Funda Ergun, Dr. Arrvindh Shriraman, and probably many others. You can refer to [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160802213853/http://www.sfu.ca/madd-gen/faculty-researchers.html) for more info. Apart from Dr. Martin Ester, I don't know whether other aforementioned professors deceived and under-funded their students similarly, but I think some level of deception existed.

Like Cenk but to a lesser degree, if those people didn't even honor the promises they made to the FUNDING agency, why would they honor the promises made to you, once you become their student?

### A (unsuccessful) defense for Cenk

Now let's come up with a defensive argument for Cenk, note that I don't know the complete truth for sure: When Cenk became the MADD-Gen program's rotational chair, it was already quite obvious that some of MADD-Gen program's promises couldn't be kept, e.g., the promised course offerings. Thus, the program's termination would be inevitable no matter whether Cenk worked on student exchanges and internships or not. If so, is Cenk still so guilty in not performing his duties?

The answer is still YES.
