# Think twice before becoming Cenk Sahinalp's student

[Dr. S. Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/s-cenk-sahinalp) is an accomplished scholar in bioinformatics. His research excellence is remarkable: apart from his shiny titles and outstanding publications, I also heard people, including both his students and collaborators, praising his research work in private. He is said to have a solid grasp of his research fields, and whatever paper he writes is guaranteed good quality.

However, a great researcher as he is, I have a very negative judgment of him, both as a supervisor and as a person, although I've never been his student or directly interacted with him in any way.

**He is very selfish, completely disregarding his responsibility or other people's interests while pursuing his own interest, probably even committing minor fraud. It may even suffice to say, he is slightly despicable.**

## Problem 1: Deceptive

**He is deceptive and doesn't care about his students.** Dr. Sahinalp has been a professor at Simon Fraser University (SFU) between 2003 and 2019, but between 2013 and 2019, he was also a professor at Indiana University Bloomington. Do you think he spent around half-half time in each of those universities during this overlapping period of 2013-2019? No. Ever since he started working at Indiana University, he rarely (if ever at all) returned to SFU in person, only holding a position in SFU; however, when recruiting students to SFU, he told them he'd be "at SFU half the time". The students would find out the truth only after starting their studies at SFU, then they had to find another local professor/postdoc to act as an on-site co-supervisor, while having a weekly 1-1 video conferencing with Cenk. At least that's what happened to some cohorts of students I know of, but most likely, other cohorts suffered a similar fate, based on Cenk's selfish and irresponsible character depicted in this article. At the time, we joked that Cenk was like a "shadow figure" in our department: we hear about his name frequently, but never see him in real life.

You might think that video conferencing with Cenk is still very helpful for those students, but meeting Cenk in person should never be a privilege in the first place: it should be their right, unless they were informed of his complete absence before they accepted the PhD/MSc offer. Even with tools like video conferencing, face-to-face interaction is still indispensable, especially in a close relationship like a supervisor-student relationship, and even more so for supervisors and students who have never met in person. This distance and unfamiliarity don't bode well for the quality of guidance those students would get, but Cenk couldn't care less. This deception from Cenk probably constitutes a minor fraud ([definition](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-380.html)).

## Problem 2: Extremely irresponsible

**Another problem is that, his irresponsibility severely harms both his and other professors' students.** Cenk was heavily involved in a bioinformatics program at SFU called MADD-Gen, funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada). This program was short-lived, terminated by NSERC at the end of 2016, which cut off funding sources for graduate students recruited under this program, and I was hit especially hard (see [this article](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md) for more details). It got terminated prematurely due to MADD-Gen committee's failure to meet the promises they made to NSERC when creating this program. 

From what I know, Cenk's inaction and irresponsibility were a major factor behind this failure. To get the NSERC funding, MADD-Gen committee made many promises including offering certain courses, offering students exchange opportunities with some partner institutions, sending students into internship programs, etc. These were also selling points to attract prospective graduate students. When Cenk was the rotational chair of the MADD-Gen program, he neglected his administrative responsibilities, only focusing on his work at Indiana University. Some older students told me that Cenk didn't send students for exchange during this period of time. Although the exchange activities resumed to normal levels after another professor became the rotational chair, it was too little too late: they'd never be able to meet the promise for the number of students exchanged, and the funding termination would be inevitable.

This story not only showed how selfish and despicable Cenk truly was, but also an astonishing amount of incompetence and irresponsibility in SFU School of Computing Science. 

Unlike some other of their failures that are truly hard to avoid, for example, inability to successfully open some courses promised in MADD-Gen program plan due to little to no students enrolling, sending students for exchange isn't something difficult to do: it just requires a small amount of attention and effort from the program chair, he didn't have to create anything new, as the exchange program was already running smoothly under the earlier rotational chairs. Yet Cenk refused to fulfill such a simple responsibility, probably because it wouldn't bring him direct benefit, and he didn't care about the students' development or the long-term success of MADD-Gen.
