## Overview

**TL, DR; Prof. [Martin Ester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ester) deceived me into becoming his master's student by making false funding promises, which eventually weren’t fulfilled. I launched a legal claim against him and successfully got back some of my owed funding. This article describes lessons I learned from the story and my advice to readers, I also have my demand letter included in the appendix.**

A shorter version of this article is [on Medium](https://antonfeng.medium.com/martin-esters-breach-of-law-and-lessons-i-learned-from-my-legal-claim-7fdc964e8500?source=friends_link&sk=a0e0f646d00f85686031fd29623badaa), which doesn't have the appendices containing the demand letter.

Disclaimer: *This article only shows an aspect of Dr. Martin Ester, for which I have lots of compelling evidence to support my claims; it doesn’t indicate his personality in other aspects. Besides, these issues don’t mean Dr. Ester is a particularly bad professor: I’m pretty sure his problems are quite widespread in academia and comparatively he wasn’t that bad, although he was nowhere close to being truly good either. I'm not legally responsible for anyone distorting, exaggerating, falsifying, or misinterpreting anything mentioned in this article.

## The Story
Dr. [Martin Ester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ester) is a world-renowned computer scientist. He is the first author of the famous [DBSCAN paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3001460.3001507), which has close to 27,000 citations at the beginning of 2023. Among his many honors, he is a Royal Society of Canada (RSC) Fellow, and he was named the world's No. 1 most influential data-mining expert in 2016. 

However, Dr. Martin Ester also has skeletons in his cupboard: he violated the law due to breach of contract, by making false funding promises to recruit me as his master’s student, and eventually didn’t fulfill these promises. Several years after graduation, I started a legal claim against him and successfully got back some of the owed funding. 

Yes, a world-renowned scientist, an RSC fellow, would rather violate the Contract Law than pay me 6430.72 CAD (~5,000 USD), which was already much lower than what I could’ve asked for based on my offer letter. 

### Condensed timeline of events
Before I go into the lessons I learned from this legal claim, let me give you a bit of background by presenting you with a condensed timeline of events.
