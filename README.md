## Some important articles
- [Martin Ester's breach of law and lessons I learned from my legal claim](https://github.com/simonfqy/bare_bone_blog/blob/main/About%20Martin%20Ester%20and%20Academia/Martin%20Ester's%20breach%20of%20law%20and%20lessons%20I%20learned%20from%20my%20legal%20claim.md), a story about how [Prof. Martin Ester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ester), a world-renowned computer scientist, deceived me into becoming his master's student by making false funding promises and didn't fulfill them, my successful legal claim against him, and important lessons I learned from the story which could help readers. I also have an identical version [on my personal website](https://www.antonfeng.me/martin-esters-breach-of-law-and-lessons-i-learned) and a shorter version [on Medium](https://antonfeng.medium.com/martin-esters-breach-of-law-and-lessons-i-learned-from-my-legal-claim-7fdc964e8500?source=friends_link&sk=a0e0f646d00f85686031fd29623badaa) which doesn't have the appendix.
